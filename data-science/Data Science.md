## Four Flavor of Data Science

1. Data analysis
   - Data analysis is a process for making sense of data
   - Data analysis could include data cleaning, reformatting and recombining data
   - Data analysis is carried out with the express intention of discovering trends, patterns, and finding in data that describe real-life phenomenon
2. Data science
   - Data science is the systematic study of the structure and behavior of data in order to quantifiably understand past and current occurrences, as well as predict the future behaviour of that data
3. Artificial Intellegence
   - A machine or application with the capacity to autonomously execute upon predictions it makes from data
     - Prediction
       - Predictive modeling from data sciene
     - Execution
       - Autonomous response from engineering
4. Deep Learning
   - Deep learning is a set of predictive mthodologies that borrows its strucvture from the neural network structures of the brain. This class of method is particularly effective for making predictions from big data
   - Deep learning is sub-field within data science, and it can be used as a decision model with application to produces deep learning AI
